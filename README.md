# Cluster Inventory API

The Cluster Inventory API is a part of [SIG Multicluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-multicluster),
and this repository serves as the foundation for developing a standardized,
robust framework for multi-cluster management in a cloud-native environment.

The Cluster Inventory API aims to provide a consistent and automated approach for applications,
frameworks, and toolsets to discover and interact with multiple Kubernetes clusters.
The concept of Cluster Inventory is akin to service discovery in a microservices architecture.
It allows multi-cluster applications to dynamically discover available clusters and respond to various cluster lifecycle events.
Such events include auto-scaling, upgrades, failures, and connectivity issues.
This automated inventory management not only facilitates operational efficiency
but also supports the integration of diverse multi-cluster management solutions.
See the initial proposal in the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUWbe81BTclQ4Uax3flnCoKtEWngH-JA9MyCqljJCBM/)
for more details.

## Cluster Profile API

Within the broader Cluster Inventory, the first major component we are introducing is the
[ClusterProfile API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-multicluster/4322-cluster-inventory/README.md).
A Cluster Profile is essentially an individual member of the Cluster Inventory that details the properties and status of a cluster.
This API proposes a universal, standardized interface that defines how cluster information should be presented
and interacted with across different platforms and implementations.

### Motivation and Goals

The `ClusterProfile API` is designed to establish a shared interface for cluster inventory,
laying the groundwork for multi-cluster tooling by providing a foundational component.
Here are several key benefits and purposes of adopting the ClusterProfile API:

- **Standardization**: By defining a standard for status reporting and cluster properties,
the API facilitates a common understanding that can be shared across various tools and platforms.
- **Ease of Integration**: Consumers of the API, such as multi-cluster workload schedulers and GitOps tools (e.g., ArgoCD, Kueue),
can integrate without needing to navigate the specific implementation details of different cluster management projects.
- **Vendor Neutrality**: The API provides a vendor-neutral integration point,
allowing operations tools and external consumers to define and manage clusters across different cloud environments uniformly.
